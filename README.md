# Hey, I'm @KasperG21 ðŸ‘‹
I talk to computers, so that would make me a programmer I think?
Anyway, for the moment I speak javascript, rust, C#, python, and some limited knowledge of random other languages.

If someone is interested in anything I do, then you can always contact me on discord: @toxicwolf_393
