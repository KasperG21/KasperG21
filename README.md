# Hey, I'm @KasperG21 ðŸ‘‹
I talk to computers, so that would make me a programmer, right?
Anyway, for the moment I speak javascript, rust, C# and python, but I know how to say hello in some other languages too.

If you are interested in anything I do or have done, you can always contact me on discord: @toxicwolf_393
